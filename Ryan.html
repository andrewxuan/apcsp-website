<h1>About Ryan</h1>
<p>My name is Ryan Song. I'm a junior at CCA. I like to discuss politics with my friends. 
I started coding this year, with my first language being MIT App Inventor. I really enjoy learning how to code, as I beleive that computers are going to be Earth's future.
I have many hobbies. I love researching new breakthroughs in science, and I love reading the news. From a young age, I was always intrigued about websites. I always wanted to be able to make my own. And now, you are surfing on my project, a real website. I hope you enjoyed learning about me!</p>
