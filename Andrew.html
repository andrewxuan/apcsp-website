<h1>About Andrew</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Andrew Xuan and I am a junior at Canyon Crest Academy. I love long walks on the beach with everyone and anyone. When I grow up, I would like to live near the beach. As well as walking on the beach, I love swimming in the ocean.</p>

<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>My favorite subjects are biology, chemistry, and calculus. Besides academics, I participate in Track and Field and swimming at a competitive level. Perhaps swimming is my favorite past time due its psychological and physical benefits.</p>
